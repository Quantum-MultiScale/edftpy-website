eDFTpy: Density Embedding Scheme with Python
============================================

eDFTpy combines Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) and orbital-free DFT (OF-DFT) in an embedding framework that distills the best of both worlds whereby only weak intermolecular interactions are left to OF-DFT, and strong intramolecular interactions are left to KS-DFT. The code achieves near ideal linear-scaling with system size. eDFTpy is based on DFTpy_ for OF-DFT operations and QEpy_ to solve the KS-DFT equations. eDFTpy is developed as part of the `Quantum MultiScale <https//quantum-multiscale.org>`_ collaboration.
